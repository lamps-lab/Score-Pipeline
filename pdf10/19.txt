A

key result of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is that the market portfolio—the portfolio of all
assets in which each asset’s weight is proportional to its total market capitalization—lies on the meanvariance-efficient frontier, the set of portfolios having mean-variance characteristics that cannot be improved
upon. Therefore, the CAPM cannot be consistent with efficient frontiers for which every frontier portfolio has
at least one negative weight or short position. We call such efficient frontiers “impossible,” and show that
impossible frontiers are difficult to avoid. In particular, as the number of assets, n, grows, we prove that the
probability that a generically chosen frontier is impossible tends to one at a geometric rate. In fact, for one
natural class of distributions, nearly one-eighth of all assets on a frontier is expected to have negative weights for
every portfolio on the frontier. We also show that the expected minimum amount of short selling across frontier
portfolios grows linearly with n, and even when short sales are constrained to some finite level, an impossible
frontier remains impossible. Using daily and monthly U.S. stock returns, we document the impossibility of
efficient frontiers in the data.

Introduction

assets increases without bound. This result depends,
of course, on the specific distribution from which
we draw the covariance matrix; we consider two
classes: the uniform distribution (Haar measure), and
distributions centered around linear factor models
such as the CAPM and Ross’s (1976) arbitrage pricing theory (APT). For both classes of distributions,
mean-variance-efficient frontiers are almost surely
impossible.
This remarkable result is not an artifact of pathological parameters, except in the two-asset case, but is
a generic property of mean-variance-efficient portfolios. For typical parameter values, every portfolio on
the efficient frontier will contain at least one short
position, i.e., a negative weight. This implies that
such an efficient frontier cannot be consistent with a
CAPM equilibrium in which every investor holds the
tangency portfolio, for such an equilibrium requires
all weights to be positive for that portfolio. Alternatively, our impossibility result implies that the set
of expected-return vectors and covariance matrices,
!!" "#, that are consistent with a CAPM equilibrium is
extremely small—in fact, measure zero in the limit—
hence we should not expect typical empirical estimates of !!" "# to yield plausible portfolios from the
CAPM perspective unless the CAPM is literally true
and estimation error is negligible.

A cornerstone of modern portfolio management is the
“efficient frontier” of mean-variance analysis: the set
of portfolios for which the lowest variance possible is
attained for a given level of expected return, or the
highest possible expected return is attained for a given
level of variance. The main thrust of the capital asset
pricing model (CAPM) is that the market portfolio—
the portfolio of all assets in which each asset’s weight
is proportional to its total market capitalization—must
lie somewhere on the efficient frontier. Because, by
definition, every component of the market portfolio
has a nonnegative weight (since its market capitalization must be nonnegative), we would expect at least
one portfolio on the efficient frontier to have this property. If, for a given a set of asset-return parameters
(means, variances, and covariances), the corresponding efficient frontier does not have any such portfolio, we call this an “impossible frontier” for obvious
reasons.
In this paper, we show that as the number of
assets grows large, nearly all efficient frontiers are
impossible.
Specifically, for any arbitrary set of expected returns
and for a randomly chosen covariance matrix, we
show that the probability that the resulting frontier is impossible approaches one as the number of

Our results provide one explanation for the skepticism that most long-only portfolio managers have
for standard mean-variance optimization. From their
perspective, an impossible frontier is truly impossible
for them to implement. Moreover, it is well known
that the output of standard portfolio optimizer yields
weights that must be constrained, but until now,
the nonnegativity restriction that has become second
nature to practitioners was thought to be a consequence of estimation error. The results in our paper
show that even in the ideal case in which the means
and covariance matrix of asset returns are known
with perfect certainty, the efficient frontier will almost
always contain negative weights. To the extent that
estimation error generates means and covariances that
deviate from the CAPM, such sampling variation will
only exacerbate the problem, making it more likely
that the sample efficient frontier is impossible. Our
impossibility results may also provide a partial explanation for the recent popularity of so-called “active
extension” strategies such as “130/30” portfolios in
which a limited amount of short selling is permitted.
We begin in §2 with a brief review of the literature, and in §3 we derive analytical results for the
two- and three-asset cases to build intuition and motivate our more general results. The main results of
this paper are contained in §4, where we propose
two classes of probability measures over the space of
all possible covariance matrices and show that under
both of these classes of measures, impossible frontiers
become the rule, not the exception, as the number of
assets increases without bound. We also show that
the expected minimum amount of short selling across
frontier portfolios grows linearly with n, and even
when short sales are constrained to some finite level,
an impossible frontier remains impossible. Given the
importance of the CAPM, in §5 we examine the linear one-factor return-generating model in more detail,
and show how to construct a covariance matrix that
does not yield an impossible tangency portfolio. In §6,
we provide an empirical illustration of our theoretical
findings using daily and monthly returns for a subset
of S&P 500 stocks, and show that the usual sample
estimators of !!" "# do yield impossible frontiers. We
conclude in §7 with a discussion of the theoretical and
practical significance of our results.

Literature Review

Any review of the mean-variance portfolio selection
literature must begin with Markowitz (1952), who
first introduced this powerful framework to the economics literature. Building on the Markowitz meanvariance framework, Tobin (1958), Sharpe (1964), and
Lintner (1965) derived the equilibrium implications
under the assumption that all investors held meanvariance-optimal or “efficient” portfolios, culminating

in the “capital market line,” the line connecting the
risk-free rate on the expected-return axis with the
tangency portfolio on the efficient frontier in mean–
standard deviation space.
The role of short sales in mean-variance analysis
has also been considered by several authors. In fact,
Markowitz (1959, p. 132) recognized the importance of
implementing constraints on portfolio weights, one of
which was a nonnegativity or short-sales constraint.
However, Lintner (1965) was perhaps the first to study
the impact of short sales on capital market equilibrium, deriving alternative equilibria under shortsales prohibitions as well as short-sales constraints.
Lintner concluded that investors would not engage
in short sales in equilibrium because of the Tobin
separation theorem, i.e., all investors are indifferent
between holding portfolios of all assets and portfolios
of just two funds: the riskless asset and the tangency
portfolio.
The importance of the mean-variance efficiency of
the market portfolio was recognized early on by
many authors, who initiated a series of debates on
the testable implications of the CAPM. In particular, Roll (1977), Rudd (1977), Roll and Ross (1977),
Green (1986), Green and Hollifield (1992), and Best
and Grauer (1985, 1992) all acknowledged the potential incompatibility of an arbitrary set of means and
covariances with positive weights for frontier portfolios. Roll (1977) and Roll and Ross (1977) present
qualitative arguments for frontier portfolios to have
positive weights, and Rudd (1977) corrects and quantifies some of those arguments. Using the dual of
the standard mean-variance quadratic optimization
problem, Green (1986) derives a fascinating necessary and sufficient condition for the efficient frontier to be impossible—the existence of a nontrivial
zero-expected-return arbitrage portfolio (a portfolio
with weights that sum to zero) that has nonzero correlation with all assets. Green and Hollifield (1992)
derive conditions under which frontier portfolios will
be well diversified, meaning they contain no extreme
weights, and argue that extreme weights are likely
in the presence of a single dominant factor in asset
returns. Jagannathan and Ma (2003) show that, despite
this fact, portfolios with nonnegativity constraints
often perform better than unconstrained counterparts
because the constraints reduce the impact of estimation error. And given a positive vector of market
weights and a covariance matrix, Best and Grauer
(1985) derive the restrictions on the vector of expected
returns that imply that the given vector of market
weights is an efficient portfolio.
But the most relevant paper for our purposes is Best
and Grauer (1992). In addition to providing conditions
for all frontier portfolios to have positive weights,
they derive a beautiful result: if a frontier contains

Brennan and Lo: Impossible Frontiers

907

Management Science 56(6), pp. 905–923, © 2010 INFORMS

portfolios with positive weights, they all lie on a continuous segment of the frontier! Using this fact, they
show that as the number of assets increases without bound, and assuming that the CAPM holds (so
that the vector of expected returns and the covariance
matrix is consistent with the mean-variance efficiency
of the vector of market weights), the line segment
of frontier portfolios with positive weights converges
to a single point under certain conditions. Given
the implausibility of these conditions, and the sensitivity of frontier portfolios to small perturbations
in the vector of expected returns (documented in
Best and Grauer 1991a, b), they argue that frontiers
with all positive weights are highly unlikely in practice. Our results confirm this intuition, but without
any restrictions whatsoever on the vector of expected
returns.
More recently, Markowitz (2005, p. 17) argued that
empirical deviations from the CAPM are not surprising in light of the counterfactual assumptions on
which the CAPM is based. In particular, he observes
that “[w]hen one clearly unrealistic assumption of the
capital asset pricing model is replaced by a real-world
version, some of the dramatic CAPM conclusions no
longer follow.” An example is the fact that unlimited
borrowing and lending at identical yields is not possible in practice, and this limitation implies that the
market portfolio need not be mean-variance efficient
in equilibrium.
Markowitz’s (2005) caveats are well taken, but the
results of our paper are considerably stronger—we
show that even if all the assumptions of the CAPM
are true, the market portfolio need not be meanvariance efficient. Specifically, Markowitz (2005) states
the following assumptions:
(A1) Transaction costs and other illiquidities can be
ignored.
(A2) All investors hold mean-variance-efficient
portfolios.
(A3) All investors hold the same (correct) beliefs
about means, variances, and covariances of securities.
(A4) Every investor can lend all she or he has or
can borrow all she or he wants at the risk-free rate.
Markowitz (2005) then concludes that:
(C1) The market portfolio is a mean-varianceefficient portfolio.
The results of §§3–5 show that there exist certain
combinations of means, variances, and covariances for
which every mean-variance-efficient portfolio contains
short positions, implying that none can be the market
portfolio. And as the number of assets grows without bound, the likelihood of coming across a set of
parameter values with this characteristic approaches
certainty.

Some Examples of Impossible
Frontiers

We begin with some notation. Let ! be the vector of
expected returns for n assets, and let " be the covariance matrix of those returns.1 For a given level of
expected return, $o , the corresponding portfolio on
the efficient frontier is the vector #, which minimizes
the value of
#" "#

subject to #" $ = 1"

# " ! = $o "

(1)

where $ is a column vector of ones of the appropriate length. The set of optimal # can be found using
the method of Lagrange multipliers (see, for example,
Merton 1972):
"
#
!
B

C ≡ $" "−1 $" D ≡ AC − B 2 "

(3)

#g ≡ "−1 $/C"

(4)

#$ ≡ "−1 !/B&

Note that #g is the global minimum-variance portfolio, and #$ is the vector that maximizes the Sharpe
ratio relative to the risk-free
√ rate of zero, i.e., #$ maximizes the function !" #/ #" "#.
The frontier starts at the expected return level
$o = B/C. In fact, we can compute minimum-variance
portfolios for values of $o less than B/C, but these
portfolios would lie on the “inefficient” branch of
the portfolio frontier, i.e., the portion of the frontier
for which the expected return is not maximized for a
given level of risk.
We call a frontier “impossible” with respect to the
ith component if the weight of the ith component at
each point on the frontier is negative. Clearly, a sufficient condition for a frontier to be impossible is that
it be impossible for the ith asset, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. From (2),
we see that every point on an efficient frontier can be
written in the form
"
#
B
C
(5)
$o −
#P + #g "
#=
D
C
where #P ≡ B#$ − B#g . The values of C and D are
nonnegative by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, so

Throughout this paper, we maintain the following notational conventions: (1) all vectors are column vectors unless otherwise indicated; (2) matrix transposes are indicated by primes, hence #" is
the transpose of #; and (3) vectors and matrices are always typeset
in boldface, i.e., X and $ are scalars and X and ! are vectors or
matrices.

a frontier will be impossible with respect to the ith
asset exactly when #g and #P both have negative ith
components.
Our technique for proving that an efficient frontier
is impossible is to show that the ith elements of both
#g and #P are negative for some i. Using this method,
we can calculate a lower bound for the probability
that a generically chosen efficient frontier is impossible, as well as lower bounds for the expected number of negative weights of portfolios on an impossible
frontier and lower bounds on the expected amount of
total short sales at each point on the frontier.
In §3.1, we investigate the special case of n = 2
and find that certain frontiers are impossible, but only
under some rather unnatural conditions. However, in
§3.2, we show that when n = 3, a variety of frontiers
become impossible without any unnatural conditions.
3.1. The Two-Asset Case
For the case of n = 2 assets, we can characterize all situations in which a frontier will be impossible (proofs
are included in the appendix).
Proposition 1. For n = 2, let the assets be ordered so
that $1 < $2 , let 'i denote the risk of the ith asset, and
let ( denote the correlation between the assets. The efficient
frontier is impossible if and only if
'2
< (&
'1
Because ( ≤ 1, the proposition implies that a necessary condition for a frontier with two assets to be
impossible is that '2 < '1 . Also, because the volatilities are both nonnegative, it is also necessary that
( > 0. Thus, for a frontier to be impossible, the asset
with higher expected return must also have lower
risk, and the two assets must be positively correlated.
In such a circumstance, it will be optimal to have
a short position in the low-return/high-risk asset at
every point on the efficient frontier.
This condition is unnatural because the lower
expected-return asset is strictly dominated by the
higher expected-return asset, given that the latter is
less risky than the former. Therefore, on purely economic grounds, it is possible to rule out impossible
frontiers in the two-asset case. In the next section,
however, we show that with just one more asset, there
is no natural way to avoid impossible frontiers.
3.2. The Three-Asset Case
For n = 3 assets, we describe a class of mean returns,
variances, and covariances indexed by a parameter
) > 0 such that for sufficiently small values of ),
the efficient frontier corresponding to the specified
parameters is impossible, and that the short-sale
amount throughout the frontier becomes arbitrarily

large as ) approaches 0. Unlike the case of the condition in Proposition 1, no dominance relation among
the assets is necessary; in fact, all three assets have
the same ratio of expected return to standard deviation. After deriving the formal results for this class of
parameters, we provide a specific numerical example
and also indicate the range of values of ) for which
frontiers in this class are impossible.
For each 0 < ) < 1, let d = 1 − ), and define the
following set of asset-return parameters:




d
d




! = $2 

1/d
(6)


4
1 d d



"=
 d 1 d "
d4 d 1

where ! is the vector of expected returns, % is the
vector of standard deviations, and " is the correlation matrix. We assume that $2 > 0 and '2 > 0. The
ratio of expected return to standard deviation for each
asset is thus $2 /'2 . Also, the correlation between the
first and the second asset is positive and identical
to that between the second and third asset, whereas
the correlation between the first and third asset is
positive but somewhat smaller because d 4 < d. We
prove below that the efficient frontiers corresponding
to the class of parameters described by (6) are impossible for sufficiently small values of ). Before deriving this result, however, we must confirm that the
correlation matrix specified in (6) is positive definite,
which is accomplished by the following lemma (see
the appendix for the proof):
Lemma 1. The correlation matrix " specified in (6) is
positive definite for all 0 < ) < 1.
With this lemma in hand, we now prove that frontiers described in (6) are impossible when ) is sufficiently small.
Proposition 2. For sufficiently small values of ), the
frontier corresponding to the parameters described in (6) is
impossible. Each frontier portfolio can be expressed as
# = *#
( P + #g "
for * ≥ 0, where #
( P = !12/B##P . There are values
0 < *1 < *2 such that the weight of the second asset is negative for each portfolio in the range 0 ≤ * ≤ *2 and the
first asset is negative for each portfolio in the range * > *1 .
Therefore, there is always at least one asset with a negative weight, and for values of * between *1 and *2 , two
assets have negative weights. Moreover, each portfolio on
the frontier has a negative weight that is at least as large
as 1/!3)# + O!1#.

This proposition demonstrates that impossible
frontiers can arise easily in the three-asset case,
and without imposing any unnatural conditions on
the asset-return parameters. In practice, numerical
computations show that frontiers corresponding to
the parameters in (6) become impossible whenever
) ≤ 0&317.
For concreteness, consider a numerical example
with the following parameter values: ) = 0&2,
$2 = 12%, and '2 = 20%. In this case, we have

The value of * for which the first coordinate of # is
zero is *1 = 0&5208, and the value of * for which the
second coordinate of # is zero is *2 = 1&7493. For values of * between 0 and *1 , the weight of the second
asset is negative, and the weights of the other two
assets are positive. For values of * between *1 and *2 ,
the weights of both the first and second assets are
negative, and the weight of the third asset is positive.
Finally, for values of * greater than *2 , the weight of
the first asset is negative, and the weights of the other
two assets are positive. Therefore, the efficient frontier
is impossible. Moreover, each portfolio on the frontier
has a total short-sale amount of at least −63&9% of the
total asset value.
The circumstances in which impossible frontiers can
arise in the case of three assets is not limited to just
those parameters described by (6). In fact, the efficient frontier will continue to be impossible if the
values of the risk, return, and covariance parameters
are allowed to vary within a small neighborhood of
(6). In addition, many other three-asset examples of
impossible frontiers with empirically plausible parameters can be constructed. By increasing the number of
assets from two to three, the set of impossible frontiers
has grown significantly. In §4, we show that this is no
coincidence, and that as n increases without bound, an
arbitrarily chosen frontier is almost surely impossible.

4.

The General Case

In this section, we consider the general case of an arbitrary number of n assets. Unfortunately, simple analytical results like those for the two- and three-asset
cases of §3 are not available for an arbitrary number
of assets (but see Green 1986; Best and Grauer 1985,
1992 for other useful characterizations of impossibility, including computationally explicit methods for
identifying impossible frontiers). Instead, we propose
to conduct the following thought experiment: for a
given vector ! of expected returns and a randomly
selected covariance matrix ", what is the likelihood
that the resulting frontier is impossible? To compute
such a probability, we must, of course, propose a probability distribution for a covariance matrix, which is
not a straightforward exercise. Although distributions
of covariance matrices have been developed in the
statistics literature, e.g., the Wishart distribution, they
are sampling distributions of covariance-matrix estimators applied to independently and identically distributed multivariate normal data (see Anderson 1984,
Chap. 7). Such distributions are highly parametric—
if multivariate normality does not hold, then neither
does the Wishart—and also do not necessarily capture
the randomness that we seek, i.e., the random drawing of an arbitrary population covariance matrix from
the space of all possible covariance matrices. In particular, Wishart distributions are typically “centered”
at the estimated sample covariance matrix with multivariate tails that decline exponentially fast. This may
be a reasonable model of the randomness associated
with sampling variation, but seems less compelling
as a mechanism for drawing an arbitrary covariance
matrix at random.
Instead, we seek a more general distribution, such
as a uniform distribution over the space of all possible covariance matrices, i.e., the space of all !n × n#
symmetric positive-definite matrices with real elements. However, because this space is not compact,
a uniform distribution over this space will have infinite mass. Nevertheless, in the same way that an
“improper prior” can be specified in Bayesian inference (see, e.g., Jeffreys 1961, pp. 180–181; Box and
Tiao 1973, p. 426), we can construct an “uninformative” distribution as a proxy for the uniform. We provide such a distribution for covariance matrices in
§4.1, which will allow us to gauge the probability that
a randomly selected covariance matrix gives rise to
an impossible frontier, yielding the conclusion that
impossible frontiers are almost certain to arise as the
number of assets increases without bound.
However, it may be argued that an uninformative distribution of covariance matrices will not yield
economically relevant draws because the resulting
covariance matrices lack the factor structure hypothesized in the most popular asset-pricing models. We

Brennan and Lo: Impossible Frontiers

910

Management Science 56(6), pp. 905–923, © 2010 INFORMS

address this concern in §4.2 by introducing another
class of probability distributions centered around the
covariance matrices generated by linear factor-pricing
models such as the CAPM and APT, and derive lower
bounds on the probability that a frontier is impossible
if it is chosen randomly with respect to one of the distributions in this class. We show that this lower bound
also approaches unity as n grows without bound.
In §4.3, we calculate lower bounds on the expected
number of assets with respect to which a frontier will
be impossible, as well as estimates for the expected
minimum size of short positions across frontier portfolios. We also find that an impossible frontier will
remain impossible even if constraints are placed on
the total amount of short selling allowed in any
portfolio.
4.1. Impossibility with a Uniform Prior
Without any prior information for what a covariance matrix “should” look like, a plausible starting
point for generating a “randomly selected” covariance matrix is to apply a uniform distribution over
the space of all real symmetric positive definite (n × n)
matrices. This problem is closely related to the invariance principle in Bayesian statistical decision theory,
which states that “if two decision problems have the
same formal structure & & & , then the same decision rule
should be used in each problem” (Berger 1985, p. 390).
This principle depends critically on the absence of
prior information which, in turn, requires that the
prior distribution also be uninformative and “invariant,” i.e., scale independent. To formalize this notion
of invariance, Berger (1985, Chap. 6.6, Definition 2)
defines a group structure on the set of transformations of the data, and then defines a parametric family of probability measures to be invariant under this
group if the parameters are invariant across all actions
of the group. For example, under the group of scale
transformations
Y = gc !X# ≡ cX"

(7)

the exponential density function
f !x ! +# = + −1 exp!−x/+#
is invariant because the density of Y is given by (see
Berger 1985, p. 394)
−1

c f !y/c ! +# = !c+#

−1

exp!−y/!c+## = f !y ! c+#&

(8)

Of course, the principle of invariance is considerably
more general, and can be applied to arbitrary groups
defined on arbitrary collections of random variables.
Berger (1985, Chap. 6.6) shows that the prior distribution function associated with invariant decision rules
is given by Haar measure, an extension of the uniform distribution to more general settings. We apply

this same approach to define an uninformative prior
on the space of all !n × n# covariance matrices, which
we denote by #n .
For #n , the natural group of transformations to consider is the general linear group GLn , the group of
all invertible linear transformations on Rn (or, equivalently, the group defined by all invertible !n × n#
matrices). This is the multivariate analog of the multiplicative scale transformation (7), where we wish to
define invariance with respect to the matrix multiplication of a vector of n random asset returns r by
an arbitrary invertible matrix A, yielding Ar. If the
covariance matrix of r is ", then the covariance matrix
of Ar is A"A" ; hence, we seek to construct an uninformative prior on #n that is invariant between " and
A"A" for all invertible A. It turns out that Haar measure is the only measure satisfying this property.
More formally, Haar measure is the unique measure (up to a constant) that is invariant under the
natural action of the group GLn of invertible linear
transformations on Rn on the space of covariance
matrices. For G ∈ GLn , this action is defined by " +→
G"G" for " ∈ #n , and any covariance matrix " can be
mapped to any other covariance matrix under some
such action. Thus, any such action takes a neighborhood around a specified covariance matrix to a corresponding neighborhood around any other covariance
matrix, and Haar measure assigns the same volume
to every such image of the original neighborhood. In
this sense, Haar measure behaves uniformly on all of
#n and represents an uninformative prior distribution
over all possible !n × n# covariance matrices. The following definition summarizes Haar measure on GLn
(see Jorgenson and Lang 2005 for further discussion).
Definition 1. Haar measure on #n is the measure,
,n , that is invariant under transformations of the form
" +→ G"G" , for G ∈ GLn . Thus, for any region S ⊆ #n ,
Haar measure has the property that
,n !S# = ,n !GSG" #

(9)

for all G ∈ GLn . This measure is unique up to multiplication by a positive constant, and in terms of the
elements of the matrix " = -.i" j /, we have
d,n !"# =

+
1
d.i" j "
!n+1#/2
!det!"##
i≤j

(10)

where d.i" j is the element of Euclidean measure.
Under Haar measure, the entire space #n has infinite volume so we cannot scale by a constant to transform Haar measure into a proper probability density.
Instead, we calculate the probability that a selected
frontier is impossible on cross sections of #n using
the probability density induced by Haar measure on
those cross sections. We first need to introduce a useful system of coordinates on #n with respect to which
we can easily define our cross sections.

expressed in terms of (partial) Iwasawa coordinates as
!X" W" V#, where W ∈ #2 , V ∈ #n−2 , and X ≡ -x1 " x2 /,
with x1 " x2 ∈ Rn−2 . The relationship between M and

Finally, we can also express each matrix X in terms of

R+ and +i ∈ S 1 = -0" 20/, using the relationships x1" i =
ri cos +i and x2" i = ri sin +i . Therefore, each M ∈ #n can
be written in terms of coordinates
M = !r1 " & & & " rn−2 " +1 " & & & " +n−2 " y" u" v" V#

(13)

so that the space #n can be viewed as the product
#n = !R+ #n−2 × !S 1 #n−2 × R × R+ × R+ × #n−2 &

(14)

Using the coordinate system of Definition 2, we
consider cross sections of #n that have fixed values for all coordinates except the +i . We write Z =
Z!r1 " & & & " rn−2 " y" u" v" V# for such a cross section with
specified fixed values of the coordinates r1 " & & & " rn−2 ,
y, u, v, and V. This cross section is thus a product
of !n − 2# copies of S 1 , and the measure on this cross
section induced by Haar measure on #n is
d,Z =

d+ · · · d+n−2 &
!20#n−2 1

(15)

The measure ,Z is therefore a proper probability distribution on the cross-sectional space Z; although
probabilities cannot be computed with respect to Haar
measure on all of #n , they can be computed with
respect to ,Z on each cross section Z of #n .
To calculate the probability that a covariance
matrix " gives rise to an impossible frontier, it is convenient first to change variables from " to M using
the correspondence
" = AMA" "

for specified values of ci > 0, where ej is an !n × 1#vector with 0s in all entries except for a 1 in the jth
entry, j = 1" & & & " n. Haar measure is invariant under
this change of variables, so we can replace " with
M and use Haar measure on M as the basis for our
probability calculations. We calculate the probability
that a matrix " = AMA" gives rise to an impossible
frontier for a matrix M in a cross section Z, where the
probability is calculated with respect to the distribution ,Z . In Theorem 1, we obtain a lower bound for
this probability of impossibility that depends only on
the parameter y in the specification of Z. However,
first we need a lemma that provides a useful test for
impossibility.
Lemma 2. For a frontier to be impossible with respect
to the ith coordinate, it is necessary and sufficient that

If " = AMA and i > 2, the conditions in (18) are equivalent to

and

sin +i−2 > 0"

where M has coordinates as in Definition 2.
Theorem 1. Let M ∈ Z = Z!r1 " & & & " rn−2 " y" u" v" V#

This theorem shows that for any fixed value of y,
the probability that a covariance matrix in a cross section Z gives rise to an impossible frontier tends to 1
geometrically as n grows.2 Moreover, if y is bounded
2

The intuition for this result is similar to the intuition for the fact
that the fraction of an n-dimensional unit sphere not lying in the
positive orthant tends to 1 geometrically with n. The sphere is
defined by n Euclidean variables subject to the condition that their
squares sum to 1. Under the uniform Haar measure on the sphere,
each of these n variables is independent of all of the others, and
each is equally likely to be positive or negative. Thus, the likelihood
that at least one is negative, so that a point is not in the positive
orthant, is 1 − 2−n . For the case of the probability distribution in
Theorem 1, each of the !n − 2# variables +i is independent of all the
others, and there is a likelihood py , dependent only on y, that the
ith of these variables gives rise to a frontier that is impossible with
respect to the !i + 2#th coordinate. As a result, the probability that
the frontier is impossible with respect to at least one coordinate is
at least as great as 1 − !1 − py #n−2 .

4.2. Impossibility with Linear-Factor Model Priors
Although the generality of Haar measure in representing the selection of an arbitrary covariance matrix is
compelling, some may consider it too general because
it does not differentiate among outcomes according to
their economic plausibility. In particular, Haar measure places the same probabilistic weight on covariance matrices arising from quantum mechanics as it
does on those from economic models—there is nothing intrinsic to Haar measure that incorporates economic structure. Accordingly, one could argue that
Haar measure places too much weight on financially irrelevant covariance matrices. This argument is
debatable, not in the least because we do not usually
develop economic theories to yield specific implications for covariance matrices, and hence it is not clear
what “financially relevant” covariance matrices look
like.
However, there does exist an important class of
financial models that places restrictions on assetreturn covariance matrices, and that is the set of linear
factor models such as the CAPM and APT. If a linear
factor-pricing model holds, then a “typical” covariance matrix drawn randomly from this economy will
have a different distribution than a Haar measure.
Accordingly, financial economists may prefer a more
informed prior when it comes to covariance matrices.
In this section, we introduce a class of probability
distributions based on covariance matrices motivated
by linear factor models such as the CAPM and APT,

and we calculate probabilities of impossibility with
respect to distributions in this class. The construction
of this class uses many of the techniques and notations developed in connection with our analysis of
Haar measure in §4.1, so our exposition will be less
detailed.
We start with T0 = T0 !!" $m " 'm " rf #, the covariance
matrix implied by a linear one-factor model for a chosen value of the excess expected-return vector ! and
for arbitrarily specified values of the excess expected
return on the market, $m , and the market volatility,
'm . The excess expected return values are defined
as the excess of the expected return values over the
risk-free rate, rf . Also, we assume for the moment
that there are no idiosyncratic components to asset
returns. The matrix T0 can be written
T0 = 'm2 &&" "
where & is the vector of “beta” values, & = !/$m
(recall that we have temporarily assumed no idiosyncratic shocks).
To incorporate independent idiosyncratic risks,3
nonnegative amounts can be added to diagonal elements of T0 , and the elements of the matrix may be
additionally adjusted to reflect deviations from the
CAPM. We define a family of such matrices,
$ = $ !!" $m " 'm " rf #

= 2T = 'm2 &&" + diag!'# + )$$" % ) ≥ 0" 3i ≥ 04"

and we define the subfamily $2 to be those matrices in $ with 31 = 0, 32 = 0, and 3i > 0 for 3 ≤ i ≤ n.
The notation diag!'# represents the diagonal matrix
with diagonal elements equal to the elements of the
vector '.
For any T ∈ $2 , we can write T = AA" , where A =
A!c1 " & & & " cn # is defined in (17), with c1 = )1/2 , c2 =
1/2
'm /$m , and ci = 3i for 3 ≤ i ≤ n. We write covariance matrices " in the form " = AMA" for some
M ∈ #n , and we consider probability distributions on
" defined in terms of probability distributions on M.
Because every " corresponds to a unique M under
this relationship, every probability distribution for "
can be realized in this way. Also, when M = In , we
3

Of course, if the CAPM were literally true, then the vector of
idiosyncratic risks ( would have to satisfy the linear restriction
#"m ( ≡ 0, where #m is the vector of market weights (in other words,
the random idiosyncratic shocks must sum to zero in each and
every realization, implying that their n-dimensional joint distribution is, in fact, degenerate, and lies in an !n − 1#-dimensional
subspace). However, we are not assuming that the CAPM is true;
otherwise, by definition the efficient frontier cannot be impossible.
Instead, we are using the CAPM’s one-factor model as motivation
for constructing an alternative to Haar measure for the express
purpose of generating a “randomly chosen” covariance matrix that
may be more relevant for financial applications.

have " = T, so distributions for " are “centered” on
the CAPM-based matrix T to the same extent that
distributions for M are centered on In . We can now
define a broad class of probability distributions for "
that are “centered” on CAPM-based matrices T ∈ $2 .
Definition 3. For c > 0, a distribution 1 on " ∈ #n
is in the class %!$2 5 c# if the corresponding distribution 1M on M ∈ #n can be factored into a product of
distributions

where the 1+i are uniform probability densities on
2
S 1 , where 1y is bounded above by c e−y for y ≥ 0,
and where the other distributions are arbitrary distributions on the respective spaces ri ∈ R+ , u ∈ R+ , v ∈
R+ , and V ∈ #n−2 . Here we use the notation of Definition 2 for the coordinates for M, and we use the correspondence " = AMA" for the relationship between "
and M.
We now turn to the central result of this section:
a lower bound for the probability of impossibility
that is uniform across all distributions in the class
%!$2 5 c#.

Theorem 2. For any given excess expected-return vector !, excess expected return on the market $m , market
volatility 'm , and risk-free rate rf relative to which excess
returns are defined, let 1 be a probability distribution in
%!$2 5 c# = %!$2 !!" $m " 'm " rf #5 c# for a specified c > 0.
With respect to this distribution, the probability that a random choice of " gives rise to an efficient frontier that is
impossible is bounded below by

This lower bound holds uniformly across all 1 ∈ %!$2 5 c#,
as well as across all choices of !, $m , 'm , and rf . As n
increases without bound, the probability that a generically
chosen frontier is impossible tends to unity.

The remarkable generality of Theorem 2 raises
the question of how tight the lower bound can be,
especially given the fact that we have placed no
restrictions on the excess expected-return vector !.
Table 1 shows that even for the 50-asset case—a
relatively small number of assets for most financial
applications—the likelihood of an impossible frontier
is nearly certain.
It should come as no surprise that Theorem 2 can
easily be extended to the case in which returns satisfy any linear k-factor model, k . n. In this case, the
factor !n − 2# in (24) is replaced by !n − k − 2#, and
some of the constants are slightly different, but the
asymptotic implications of the bound are identical.
As n increases without bound, the probability of an
impossible frontier approaches unity.

covariance matrices with real elements.

4.3. Characterizing the Short Positions
In this section, we derive several additional results
about impossible frontiers. We determine the expected
number of the total number of assets n with respect to
which a generic frontier will be impossible, and derive
a lower bound for the expected sizes of short positions
across a generic frontier. We also generalize Theorem 2
to the case in which a constraint is placed on the total
size of short positions at each point on the frontier.
Theorem 3. For any given excess expected-return vector !, excess expected return on the market $m , market
volatility 'm , and risk-free rate rf relative to which excess
returns are defined, let 1 be an arbitrary probability distribution in %!$2 5 c# = %!$2 !!" $m " 'm " rf #5 c#. Under this
probability distribution, the expected number of the total
number of assets n with respect to which the frontier corresponding to a random choice of " is impossible is bounded
below by
En ≥ c " !n − 2#
(25)
for a positive constant c " defined as
#
. "
1
"
c ≡

R 20!1 + max!0" y##

(26)

which depends only on the factor 1y of the probability distribution 1. If 1y is a normal distribution with unit variance, a numerical lower bound for En is !n − 2#/8.

This result follows from an estimate of the integral defining the expected value (see the appendix),
and shows that the number of assets requiring short
positions on a typical frontier grows linearly with the
number of assets.
We can also determine lower bounds for the aggregate size of the short positions among efficientfrontier portfolios. The following definition makes
this notion precise:
Definition 4. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let Si denote the infimum of the short position in the ith asset, measured
as a fraction of the portfolio’s net asset value, where
the infimum is taken over all points on a given efficient frontier. Let S denote the infimum of the aggregate amount of short selling, where the infimum is

Brennan and Lo: Impossible Frontiers

914

Management Science 56(6), pp. 905–923, © 2010 INFORMS

also taken over all portfolios on a given efficient
frontier.
With this definition, we are able to derive a lower
bound on the magnitude of shorting among efficientfrontier portfolios:
Theorem 4. For any given excess expected-return vector !, excess expected return on the market $m , market
volatility 'm , and risk-free rate rf relative to which excess
returns are defined, let 1 be an arbitrary probability distribution in %!$2 5 c# = %!$2 !!" $m " 'm " rf #5 c#. Under 1,
for 3 ≤ i ≤ n, the expected value of Si satisfies

(29)

Finally, we consider the effect of imposing shortsales constraints by first defining the concept of a constrained efficient frontier:
Definition 5. For b ≥ 0, a constrained efficient
frontier, !b , is the set of portfolio weight vectors that
provide maximum returns for given levels of volatility, subject to the condition that the total size of the
short positions in such weight vectors be no more
than a fraction b of the portfolio’s net asset value.
Such a constrained frontier is an impossible frontier
if every point on !b has a negative weight for at least
one asset.
Remarkably, imposing short-sales constraints does
not decrease the probability that a frontier is impossible, as the next result shows:
Theorem 5. Let ! be an unconstrained efficient frontier, and let !b be the corresponding constrained efficient
frontier for some b > 0. If ! is an impossible frontier, then
!b is an impossible frontier as well.
Therefore, the probability that a constrained efficient
frontier, with b > 0, is impossible is at least as large as
the probability that an unconstrained efficient frontier
is impossible.

The One-Factor Model

where rm is the stochastic market return, & is an !n×1#
constant vector, and ( is an !n × 1# stochastic vector
of idiosyncratic shocks. We assume that the expected
value of ( is zero, and we write ) for its covariance
matrix.
Let $m and 'm denote the expected return and standard deviation of rm , respectively. According to the
CAPM relation (30), the mean vector and covariance
matrix for asset returns, ! and ", respectively, can be
written in terms of $m , 'm , &, rf , and ) as
! = $rf + &!$m − rf #

and 1ri−2 and 1y are as in Definition 3. Note that if all
the functions 1ri−2 are identical, so that all the ci have a
common value c∗ , then the expected value of S has the
following lower bound:

model:

Given the overwhelming importance of the CAPM to
financial theory and practice, we consider the special
case of the linear one-factor model that underlies the
CAPM. In particular, let the !n × 1#-vector of returns

and " = &&" 'm2 + )&

(31)

The tangency portfolio implied by the CAPM is
#$ , defined in (4) as #$ ≡ "−1 !/B. And under the
assumption that ) is diagonal and ! contains all
positive elements, it can be shown that the tangency
portfolio is, in fact, not impossible; i.e., it contains
no negative weights and may, therefore, be consistent
with capital market equilibrium in which the weights
are proportional to the market capitalizations of the
securities. In this section, we explore the impossibility
of the tangency portfolio for more general residual
covariance matrices ) and with no constraints on !,
and find that, as before, impossibility is the rule, not
the exception as n increases without bound.
In §5.1, we introduce the techniques needed to characterize impossible tangency portfolios, and in §5.2,
we derive a lower bound on the probability that a
randomly selected tangency portfolio is impossible. In
§5.3, we show how to construct the unique covariance
matrix that is consistent with a given vector of means
!, the risk-free rate rf , a set of market-capitalization
weights #m , and the CAPM equilibrium (i.e., where
those market weights correspond to those of the tangency portfolio), and which is as “close” as possible
to a given covariance matrix ". In other words, we
derive the covariance matrix that is as close as possible to ", but that is also consistent with the CAPM.
5.1.

Characterizing Impossible
Tangency Portfolios
As in §4, the key to characterizing impossible tangency portfolios is the choice of coordinates in which
to express the covariance matrix, which will allow
us to focus on the portion of the matrix that is relevant for impossibility. Any covariance matrix " can be
written in the form " = AMA" , where M is a positivedefinite symmetric matrix, and where A is the unique
matrix that takes e1 to ! and ei to ei for 2 ≤ i ≤ n.4
4
Note that the definitions of A and M are slightly different here
than in §4.1, but we keep the same notation because these matrices
play the same role as before.

Brennan and Lo: Impossible Frontiers

915

Also, using techniques similar to those in §4.1, M can
be expressed in terms of partial Iwasawa coordinates
as

where w ∈ R+ , x ∈ Rn−1 , and V is a covariance matrix
of dimension !n − 1# × !n − 1#. Here we have used the
notation G-H/ for H" GH.
In these coordinates, the portfolio #$ can be
expressed simply as

#$"i =

d ≡ 1+!$2 −$1 #x1 +···+!$n −$1 #xn−1 &

Therefore, #$ is completely determined by x and !.
This allows us to characterize the impossibility of the
tangency portfolio via the following proposition:
Proposition 3. The tangency portfolio, #$ , implied by
the CAPM is impossible if and only if any one of the following three conditions holds: (i) two elements of x have
different signs; (ii) all elements of x have the same sign as
$1 /d; or (iii) the quantity !1 + $2 x1 + · · · + $n xn−1 #/d is
negative, where d ≡ 1 + !$2 − $1 #x1 + · · · + !$n − $1 #xn−1 .
We will make the most use out of the first condition
for impossibility in Proposition 3 because it describes
the bulk of the cases in which the tangency portfolio
is impossible.
5.2.

The Probability of Impossible
Tangency Portfolios
To determine the probability that the CAPM tangency
portfolio is impossible, we need to choose a probability distribution on the underlying variables &, $m ,
'm , rf , and ). Once these variables are determined,
! and " are determined as well, and Proposition 3
will allow us to assess the impossibility of the corresponding tangency portfolio.
For our probability distribution, we allow &, $m ,
'm , and rf to be specified arbitrarily—our results
will hold uniformly across any choice of these variables. With respect to ), we decompose the matrix
into components and allow all but one of those
components to be specified arbitrarily. Specifically,
we write ) as

1 is an !n − 1# × !n − 1# positivewhere * ∈ Rn−1 , )
1 and
definite matrix, and 611 > 0. The values of )
611 can be specified arbitrarily. With respect to *, we
impose a probability distribution 17 !*# on Rn−1 , and
in our probability calculations we consider several
possible choices of 17 . Thus, for our probability distribution on the underlying variables, we allow completely arbitrary specification of all terms except *,
and with respect to * we focus on a number of different choices of probability distributions on Rn−1 .
The characterization of impossibility in Proposition 3 relies on expressing " = AMA" in terms of coordinates x, w, and V for M. Our probability distribution, however, is expressed in terms of another set of
1 'm , and &. Thus,
coordinates for ", namely, *, 611 , ),
we need to calculate the relationship between these
choices of coordinates to apply the characterization of
impossibility to draws from our distribution. The relationship of primary importance will be the expression
of x in terms of the coordinates for the probability
distribution, so we now turn to this calculation.
Multiplying on the right by !A" #−1 and on the left
by A−1 in the expression for " in (31), and using the
definition of A, we see that

(36)

Because ! = $rf + &!$m − rf # and z is determined
by ! and *, we see that (36) expresses x in terms
of the coordinates for our probability distribution, as
desired. After some algebraic manipulation, we can
also write this expression for x as

This is a more useful formula for x because we are
interested in the signs of the elements of x, and this
expression shows these are the same as the signs of
1 −1 z/$1 (because the remaining multhe elements of )
tiplicative factor is always positive).
Theorem 6. Let p be the probability that the tangency
portfolio implied by the CAPM is impossible when the
probability distribution on the term * underlying the
covariance matrix ) has a distribution given by 17 . A

different signs, and equal to 0 otherwise.
We now make the result more concrete by applying
the theorem to specific choices for the distribution 17 .
Corollary 2. If 17 has an !n − 1#-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with mean !

Note that choices of 17 not centered at !
generally have a lower probability of impossibility.
However, for choices of 17 that are close to the uniform distribution, e.g., those with large variance, the
probability of impossibility will have a lower bound
similar to that in Corollary 2.
5.3. A Nonimpossible Covariance Matrix
Given the simple structure of the linear one-factor
model (30), it should be possible to find some covari1 “close” to " in some sense that
ance matrix "
yields a “nonimpossible” tangency portfolio, i.e., a
tangency portfolio that has strictly positive marketcapitalization weights #m and is consistent with !, &,
and rf . Using the techniques developed in §5.1, we
construct such a nonimpossible covariance matrix in
this section and show how it is related to Black and
Litterman’s (1992) approach to asset allocation with
prior information.
Suppose that a mean return vector, !, and a marketcapitalization weight vector, #m , are given, and consider a covariance matrix " that is derived either

Empirical Analysis

To gauge the empirical relevance of our impossibility
results, we use daily and monthly returns for stocks
in the S&P 500 index to estimate portfolio parameters
!!" "# and show that the realizations of impossible
frontiers in the historical record are nontrivial. These
results update and confirm similar empirical examples in Green (1986) and Best and Grauer (1992).
6.1. The Data
The monthly data consist of returns for stocks listed
on the S&P 500 in December of 1995 for which
monthly return data were available for the period
from January 1980 through December 2005. The daily
data consist of returns for stocks listed on the S&P
500 in December of 1995 for which daily return data
was available for the period from January 1, 1996,
through December 31, 2005. There are a total of 271
stocks in the monthly data set and 326 stocks in the
daily data set.
6.2. A 100-Stock Empirical Efficient Frontier
For concreteness, we construct the efficient frontier
for the first 100 assets for both daily and monthly
returns using standard estimators for the means and
covariance matrices. The two frontiers are plotted in
Figure 1, and we find that both are impossible. The
thin lines indicate the unconstrained frontiers, and the
thick lines indicate the frontiers constrained to allow
only 50% short selling. Figure 2 shows the amount
of short selling for points on both of these frontiers.
Clearly the short-sales constraints do not eliminate the
problem of impossible frontiers and have a significant impact on the characteristics of the constrained
optimal portfolio.

each of these frontiers. These results show that negative holdings are the rule rather than the exception
for empirical efficient frontiers, and nonnegativity
constraints are likely to have a major impact on the
characteristics of mean-variance-optimized portfolios.
6.4. Estimation Error
One possible critique of our empirical analysis is that
estimation error is likely to yield sample means and
covariances that are inconsistent with the CAPM, so
it is not surprising that we find impossible fron-

matrix must always be estimated in financial applications, estimation error is an unavoidable aspect of
practical portfolio management. Although a number
of authors have explored the impact of estimation
error on portfolio optimization (see, e.g., Brown 1976;

(Michaud 1998) have been developed in response,
none of these methods addresses the impossibility of
the population mean-variance-efficient frontier.
In particular, Theorems 1 and 2 show that impossible frontiers are almost certain to occur, even in the
absence of estimation error. To the extent that estimation error can be viewed as random perturbations of
population parameters (as opposed to perturbations
that yield parameters closer to those satisfying a
CAPM/APT relation), it is even more likely that estimated means and covariances will yield impossible
frontiers. In other words, if a frontier is impossible for
a set of population parameters, adding random noise
to those parameters is unlikely to yield frontiers that
are consistent with the CAPM.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have shown that mean-varianceefficient frontiers almost always contain short positions, implying a fundamental inconsistency between
efficiency and economic equilibrium as described by
the CAPM. This result is distinct from earlier concerns in the literature regarding the mean-variance
efficiency of the market portfolio. Those concerns
involved the observability of the total market portfolio, the existence of nontraded assets such as
human capital, estimation errors in the sample means
and covariance matrix, nonstationarities, asymmetric
information, and other capital-market imperfections.
Even in a frictionless world where all parameters
are fixed and known, and where all of the other
perfect-markets assumptions of the CAPM hold,

Brennan and Lo: Impossible Frontiers

919

Management Science 56(6), pp. 905–923, © 2010 INFORMS

mean-variance-efficient frontiers are almost always
impossible.
This surprisingly general result provides a potential
explanation for the near universal disdain with which
long-only portfolio managers regard standard meanvariance optimization techniques. These investment
professionals—who comprise the majority of end
users of commercial portfolio construction software
such as the BARRA Optimizer and the Northfield
Portfolio Optimizer—have railed against mindless
optimization for years, arguing that portfolio weights
obtained in this manner are ill behaved and must
be constrained or otherwise postprocessed. However,
the typical rationale for these complaints is that the
weights of frontier portfolios are too unstable and
too sensitive to estimation error to be of practical
value. We have identified a distinctly different rationale, which is the ubiquity of short positions in frontier portfolios, even in the absence of estimation error.
An impossible frontier is, in fact, literally impossible
for the long-only portfolio manager. The surging popularity of 130/30 and more general long/short strategies among such managers and their investors may
well be a practical manifestation and an unintended
consequence of the impossibility of mean-varianceoptimal portfolios.
The virtual certainty of impossible frontiers also has
implications for the interpretation of economic equilibrium. The converse of our impossibility theorem is
that the set of parameters, !!" "#, that are “possible,”
i.e., that are consistent with the mean-variance efficiency of the market portfolio, is a vanishingly small
set as the number of assets grows without bound.
In particular, in a CAPM equilibrium, covariances
are also endogenously determined via supply and
demand, despite the fact that most asset-pricing models focus exclusively on the properties of expected
returns in equilibrium. Is it any wonder that the set
of n means and n!n + 1#/2 covariances that is consistent with capital-market equilibrium is apparently
quite sparse?
To the disciples of general equilibrium theory, this
may be heretical, but from a broader and more practical perspective, it should not be too surprising that
the likelihood of simultaneous equality of supply and
demand across a large number of markets is small,
and increasingly less likely as the number of assets
grows. With the techniques developed in this paper,
we hope to be able to deduce other generic properties
of financial market equilibria as well as their practical
implications.

Appendix
In this appendix, we provide proofs for the main results of
this paper.
Proof of Proposition 1. When there are only n = 2
assets, we may write the set of points on the frontier
simply as
$
6
!
5
$o − $1 $2 − $o "
B
for $o ≥
&
! = #% # =
$2 − $1 $2 − $1
C
Thus, for all expected returns $o with $1 < $o < $2 , points
on the frontier have positive weight in both components,
but for all values of $o outside this range, every point on
the frontier has exactly one negative component. If the minimum value of $o , namely, $o = B/C, is less than $2 , then
at least some point on the frontier has all positive weights,
but if this value of $o is greater than $2 , then all points on
the frontier have at least one negative weight.
The condition that B/C < $2 is the same as the condition
that
$1 !e"1 "−1 $# + $2 !e"2 "−1 $#
< $2 &
!e"1 "−1 $# + !e"2 "−1 $#

The denominator on the left-hand side is nonnegative,
according to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, so we may
cross-multiply and collect terms to see that the inequality
holds exactly when e"1 "−1 $ > 0. This, in turn, is the same as
the inequality ( < '2 /'1 , so we see that a frontier will be
impossible just when '2 /'1 < ( ≤ 1 and $1 < $2 , which is
the assertion of Proposition 1. !
Proof of Lemma 1. We note that an (n × n) correlation
matrix is positive definite if its elements are the cosines of
angles between a pairs of vectors chosen from a set of n
unit vectors that span an n-dimensional space. Thus, for a
3 × 3 matrix


1 a c



M=
a 1 b "
c b 1

positive definiteness holds if there are three vectors, u1 , u2 ,
and u3 , such that a is the cosine of the angle between the
first two vectors, b is the cosine of the angle between the
last two vectors, and c is the cosine of the angle between
the first and the last vector. Any values for a and b may be
specified provided that −1 < a, b < 1, with strict inequality
necessary to avoid linear dependence among the vectors. If

Brennan and Lo: Impossible Frontiers

920

Management Science 56(6), pp. 905–923, © 2010 INFORMS

such values of a and b are specified, then the value of c
must follow the law of cosines so that
√
√
c = ab + c̃ 1 − a2 1 − b 2
(42)
for some −1 < c̃ < 1. Strict inequality is again necessary
to avoid linear dependence among the vectors. The definition of " in (6) specifies that a = d, b = d, and c = d 4 .
These values meet the requirements for positive definiteness, because c can be expressed in the form given in (42)
with c̃ = d 2 . Thus " is positive definite and the lemma
follows. !
Proof of Proposition 2. The idea of the proof is to compute #$ , #g , and #P directly. We obtain expressions for
each of these portfolios in terms of ), and we then analyze
the results to show that, for small values of ), all portfolios
on the efficient frontier are impossible. We also analyze the
results to obtain a lower bound for the minimum amount of
short selling in any portfolio throughout the entire impossible frontier.
We turn first to the explicit computation of the three portfolios. To begin, we note that the inverse covariance matrix
corresponding to the parameters in (6) is

Dividing the bracketed vector in this expression by the sum

which is the computation of #$ in terms of ) we desire. The
computation of #g proceeds similarly, with a direct computation of "−1 $ and a rescaling by the sum of vector components to obtain



where

B = $" "−1 ! =

!6)2 − 3)3 + 2)4 # > 0&
det!"#

The final inequality in the above expression holds because
$2 > 0, det!"# > 0, and 0 < ) < 1.
We now use the foregoing computations to show that the
efficient frontier is impossible for sufficiently small values
of ). Using (5), we see that every portfolio on the efficient
frontier is of the form
# = *#
( P + #g "
where * ≥ 0 and #
( P = !12/B##P . Inserting the above expressions for #P and #g , we rewrite this expression for # as

+
 −1/!3)# + 5/6 − !11/36#) + O!) #  &
1/!6)# − 1/4 − !13/72#) + O!)2 #

By solving for the value of * that makes the second coordinate zero, we see that the weight of the second asset is negative for portfolios corresponding to the range 0 ≤ * ≤ *2 ,
where *2 = 1/!6)2 # + O!1/)#. Similarly, by solving for the
value of * that makes the first coordinate zero, we see that
the weight of the first asset is negative for portfolios corresponding to the range * ≥ *1 , where *1 = 1/!12)# + O!1#.
For sufficiently small values of ), we have *2 5 *1 , and so
the efficient frontier is impossible. Specifically, the frontier
has negative weights in the second asset if * is between 0
and *2 , and negative weights in the first asset if * is greater
than *1 . Because *1 is less than *2 , there is always at least
one asset with a negative weight, and in the range between
*1 and *2 , both the first and second assets have negative
weight.
Finally, we note that the portfolio with the minimum
amount of short selling on the entire frontier occurs at the
point *1 . To see this, we observe that for * values less than
*1 , only the second asset has a negative weight, and this
weight decreases as * increases. Also, for * values greater
than *1 , the first asset has a negative weight, and it increases
with * more quickly than the negative weight of the second
asset decreases. Thus, the minimum amount of short selling
occurs at * = *1 , and for small values of ), this amount of
short selling is 1/!3)# + O!1#. !
Proof of Lemma 2. The first inequality in (18) states
that the ith component of #g is negative, and the second
inequality states that the ith component of #P = B#$ − B#g
is also negative. Together, these inequalities imply that
the ith component of each portfolio on the entire efficient
frontier has a negative weight, because C and D are always
positive, by the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, and because
frontier portfolios have the form described in (5). This
demonstrates the sufficiency of the condition for impossibility in the ith asset. The necessity also follows readily
because a negative ith component of each portfolio is only
possible if there is a negative ith component in the minimum risk portfolio, #g , as well as in the high-risk portfolios
that tend toward a positive multiple of #$ − #g .

After some algebraic rearrangements, we see that the conditions in (18) are equivalent to
x1" !i−2# w22 − x2" !i−2# w12 > 0

and x!i−2#" 2 > 0"

(43)

where we have used the facts that det!W# > 0 and w22 > 0,
because W is positive definite.
With the notation from Definition 2, we write w22 =
v, w12 = yv, x1" i−2 = ri−2 cos +i−2 , and x2" i−2 = ri−2 sin +i−2 .
Equation (43) can be rewritten in terms of these new
coordinates as
cos +i−2 − y sin +i−2 > 0

and

sin +i−2 > 0

because both ri−2 > 0 and v > 0, and this is the condition
in (19). !
Proof of Theorem 1. From Equation (19) of Lemma 2
we see that the probability, pi , that a frontier is impossible with respect to the ith coordinate, for i > 2, is just
the probability that the conditions of (19) are fulfilled
when +i−2 is chosen from the uniform distribution on S 1 =
-0" 20/. The conditions are satisfied exactly when + ∈ !0" 0#
and y < cot +i−2 , and this corresponds to a probability of
impossibility

cot−1 y"
pi =
20
where cot−1 denotes the branch of the inverse cotangent
with values between 0 and 0.
Equation (19) of Lemma 2 also shows that for a fixed
value of y, impossibility in the ith coordinate is independent
of impossibility in the jth coordinate, for i" j > 2. Thus, the
probability of impossibility in at least one of the coordinates
i > 2 is bounded below as
#n−2

and this implies the first inequality of the theorem. The
second inequality follows directly, because the inequality
cot−1 y ≥ 1/!1 + max!0" y## holds for all y. !

where we have made use of the fact that 6/7 > 1 − 1/!20#
and the fact that 19/20 > 1 − 1/!60#. Finally, we note that
!19/20#n−2 ≤ 2 exp!−!!n − 2#/!30##2/3 #&
This inequality can be proven by noting that it holds if
and only if the logarithm of the right-hand side minus
the logarithm of the left-hand side is positive for n ≥ 2.
Computation of the value of this difference shows that it is
positive for n ≤ 27, and computation of the derivative of the
difference, taken with respect to n, shows that the derivative
is positive for n ≥ 27. As a result, the difference is positive
for all n, and the inequality holds. Thus, we can bound PI
below as

with respect to which an efficient frontier is impossible
satisfies

This follows from the proof of Theorem 1, which shows
that the ith summand in the integrand is a lower bound
for the probability that a covariance matrix gives rise to an
impossible frontier for a fixed value of y. We thus see that

of the theorem. Also, in the case in which 1y !y# is a normal
distribution with unit variance, we see from a numerical
computation that

Proof of Theorem 4. If a frontier meets the necessary
and sufficient conditions of Lemma 2 for the ith coordinate
where 3 ≤ i ≤ n, then it is an impossible frontier with respect
to the ith asset. In this case, the ith components of both #g
and #P are negative, so the total amount of short selling in
the ith asset throughout the frontier is bounded below by
the amount of short selling in the ith asset for the minimumvariance portfolio. Thus, we see that

where we have used the change of coordinates " = AMA"
and the coordinates for M from Definition 2 to establish the
final equality. We thus see that the expected amount of short
selling with respect to the ith asset satisfies

where we have used the result from Lemma 2 in which a
frontier is impossible with respect to the ith asset exactly
when +i−2 ∈ !0" 0# and y < cot +i−2 . We have also used the
notation 1y and 1ri−2 from Definition 3.
Because the integrand in (44) is positive throughout the
region of integration, we can find a smaller lower bound by
restricting the size of the region of integration. We calculate

This is the lower bound in the theorem for E-Si /. The lower
bound for E-S/ follows immediately if the 1ri−2 are identical
for 3 ≤ i ≤ n. !
Proof of Theorem 5. Let !0 be the frontier constrained
to allow no short selling that corresponds to ! and !b . Let
'0 be the risk of the minimum risk portfolio on !0 , and let
$0 be the expected return of the maximum-expected-return
portfolio on !0 . Each portfolio on !b with a lower risk than
'0 must involve short selling, because '0 is the minimum
possible risk without short selling. Similarly, each portfolio
on !b with a higher expected return than $0 must involve
short selling, because $0 is the maximum possible expected
return without short selling. Thus, we need only show that
each portfolio on !b with a risk greater than or equal to
'0 and an expected return less than or equal to $0 must
involve short selling.
Let #b be a portfolio on !b with risk and expected return
'b and $b , respectively, such that 'b ≥ '0 and $b ≤ $0 . There
are weight vectors #0 and #U on !0 and ! , respectively,
with the same expected return as #b . For 0 ≤ 9 ≤ 1, write
#9 = !1 − 9##0 + 9#U

so that each #9 also has the same expected return $b . Let '9
denote the risk of #9 . Note that '9 is a decreasing function
of 9, for 0 ≤ 9 ≤ 1, because '92 is a quadratic function of 9,
and because 9 = 1 corresponds to the minimum risk portfolio for the level of expected return $b . We assume here
that ! is impossible so that #U involves short selling and
is therefore distinct from #0 . We thus see that each #9 with
9 > 0 has lower risk than #0 but the same level of return
$b . Also, the amount of short selling in #9 is positive for all
9 > 0 but goes to zero as 9 → 0. As a result, there is some
9∗ > 0 such that the amount of short selling on #9∗ is no
more than b. The existence of this #9∗ implies that 'b must
be no greater than #9∗ , and hence strictly less than the risk
of #0 . Because the risk of #b must be strictly less than the
risk of #0 , it follows that #b must involve short selling, as
desired. !
Proof of Theorem 6. From the condition for impossibility in Proposition 3 and from the expression for x in (37),
we see that the probability is bounded below by
